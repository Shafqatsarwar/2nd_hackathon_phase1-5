Hackathon II — Spec-Driven Cloud-Native AI Todo System  
1\. Purpose & Philosophy

This repository implements Hackathon II: The Evolution of Todo using Spec-Driven Development and AI-Native Architecture.

The system evolves from a simple in-memory CLI to a cloud-native, event-driven, AI-powered Todo platform, without manual coding.  
The engineer’s role is system architect, not syntax writer.

Golden Rule:  
❌ No handwritten application code  
✅ All code is generated via Claude Code from validated specs

2\. Core Principles

Spec is the Source of Truth  
All behavior, APIs, schemas, and flows originate from /specs.

AI-Native by Design  
AI agents are first-class citizens using MCP tools, not wrappers.

Stateless & Cloud-Ready  
All services are horizontally scalable and restart-safe.

Progressive Evolution  
Each phase builds on the previous without breaking contracts.

Production-Grade Defaults  
Security, auth, observability, and scalability are mandatory.

3\. Development Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

❌ Manual code writing is forbidden

❌ Ad-hoc changes outside specs are forbidden

✅ Specs must be refined until Claude Code produces correct output

✅ Every feature must have a corresponding spec

✅ Generated code must match the spec exactly

Violating these rules invalidates the submission.

4\. Supported Phases  
Phase Scope Outcome  
I Console App In-memory Python Todo  
II  Web App Full-stack, authenticated CRUD  
III AI Chatbot  MCP-powered conversational Todo  
IV  Local K8s Docker \+ Helm \+ Minikube  
V Cloud Native  Kafka \+ Dapr \+ Managed K8s

6\. Technology Constitution  
Phase-Aligned Stack (Version-Compatible)  
Core

Python ≥ 3.13

Node.js ≥ 20 LTS

TypeScript ≥ 5.4

UV for Python dependency management

Frontend

Next.js ≥ 15 (App Router) (Note: Version 16 was not stable for this kind of project till December 2025)

React ≥ 19

Tailwind CSS

OpenAI ChatKit

Backend

FastAPI

SQLModel

Neon Serverless PostgreSQL

Better Auth (JWT)

AI & Agents

OpenAI Agents SDK

Official MCP SDK

Claude Code

Spec-Kit Plus

Cloud & DevOps

Docker

Kubernetes

Helm

Minikube

kubectl-ai

kagent

Event-Driven (Phase V)

Kafka (Redpanda / Strimzi)

Dapr (Pub/Sub, State, Jobs, Secrets)

7\. Specification Governance  
Spec Categories  
Folder  Responsibility  
/specs/features User-visible behavior  
/specs/api  REST & MCP contracts  
/specs/database Schema & indexes  
/specs/ui Components & pages  
Spec Rules

Specs must be deterministic

Specs must include acceptance criteria

Specs must be referenceable using @specs/...

Specs evolve — code regenerates

8\. Authentication & Security Constitution

Authentication is mandatory from Phase II onward

JWT is the only trust mechanism

Backend never trusts frontend state

User isolation is enforced at:

API level

Database query level

MCP tool level

Environment variables are the only configuration source.

9\. AI Agent & MCP Rules

Agents must not mutate state directly

All mutations go through MCP tools

MCP tools are:

Stateless

Idempotent where possible

Database-backed

Agents confirm actions in natural language

10\. Cloud-Native & Scalability Guarantees

Services must be restart-safe

Horizontal scaling must not break behavior

Kubernetes manifests are Helm-driven

Infrastructure changes are spec-driven

Event handling is asynchronous in Phase V

11\. Observability & Reliability

Failures must be explicit

Errors must be user-friendly

Logs must be structured

Events must be auditable (Kafka)

12\. Bonus-Readiness

This architecture explicitly supports:

Reusable Intelligence (Agent Skills)

Cloud-Native Blueprints

Urdu language support

Voice commands

Multi-client real-time sync

No rewrites required.

13\. Enforcement

If a conflict exists between:

Code and Spec → Spec wins

README and Spec → Spec wins

Assumption and Spec → Spec wins

14\. Final Statement

This project is not a Todo app.  
It is a reference implementation of AI-Native, Spec-Driven, Cloud-Scale software engineering.

Write specs.  
Refine intent.  
Let agents build.
